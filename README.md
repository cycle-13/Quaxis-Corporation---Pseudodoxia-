This is to assist anyone who is looking to get into data science/analytics/predictive analysis and needs quick data that caters to your specific needs. Generate unlimited realistic pseudo retail data to perform one of the following:  Variance, Correlation, Time Series, Covariance, Mean, Median, Mode, Linear Regression, Percentiles, Moments, Normal (gaussian) distribution, Heat maps, Standard deviation, Etc...  Create your set, your way so you can practice and learn more about gaining insight into data... not THIS data. Use THIS data as a learning tool.  Data is distributed in a weighted manner although some data may be normally distributed ultimately leading into:  Time/Date/Location/Price/Combined product grouping specific sales data  EX: more sales in december at 11am or 5pm in NYC.  Higher priced items are less weighted than less priced items.  The API will serve requests while the module allows for customized data sets  You can generate any kind of retail transactions just think it through and create the set.
